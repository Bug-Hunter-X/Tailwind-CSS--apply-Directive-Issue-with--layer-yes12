This repository demonstrates a bug related to Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive when used with custom styles defined in the `@layer` directive. The `bug.css` file showcases the problem, while `bugSolution.css` provides a solution. The issue arises from the incorrect order or scope of the `@layer` and `@apply` directives.  The solution offers a corrected approach to ensure proper application of custom styles.
